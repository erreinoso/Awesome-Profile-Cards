## Awesome Profile Cards üåª

This app allows the user to create a digital card with their data: full name, position and links to their contact details and social network profiles.

We are a team of four women from very different backgrounds that came together through Adalab Bootcamp in Madrid and this is our project.

We received the following design,

but we felt we wanted to improve the project by adding a extra value: a meaningful design: Botanical Profile Cards
